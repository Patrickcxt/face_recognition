A simple project for face recognition using Deep Convolution Neural Network and SVM.
Mainly attempt to predict age and gender for a person face iamge.
Approach: fine tune DNN --> extracting features from images by DNN --> classify using Linear SVM
Package: Tensorflow, scikit-learn

=================
Extract features using Inception-v3 network
usage: python extract_incv3_features

=================
Extract features using VGG-16 network
fine-tune VGG-16: python fine_tune_vgg.py [mode](gender/age) 
extract features: python extract_vgg_fetures [mode](gender/age) [/model/path] [/features/save/path]

================
Train SVM:
python svm.py [mode](gender/age)
